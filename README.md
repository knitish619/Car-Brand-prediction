# Car-Brand-prediction
# Introduction
The main aim of this project is to predict Car brand by using Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) .Generally, people by looking at the car and they canâ€™t identify the car brand.

Deep learning practices are used for this project. Image Classification , one of the subjects of deep learning, is applied to high resolution images to extract information from these images. We used pre-trained model called RESNET 50 to train our model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of car images labeled with their corresponding brand. It is important to have a diverse and representative dataset that covers multiple car brands to train a robust model. The dataset should be divided into training, validation, and testing sets to assess the model's performance accurately.

# Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture plays a crucial role in the success of the car brand prediction task. Here is an example of a typical CNN architecture used for image classification:

Input Layer: This layer accepts the input images and passes them to the subsequent layers.

Convolutional Layers: These layers consist of multiple filters that extract meaningful features from the input images. Each filter learns to detect specific patterns or features present in the images.

Activation Layers: After each convolutional layer, an activation function (e.g., ReLU) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model and enable better feature representation.

Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the feature maps to reduce the spatial dimensions and computational complexity while retaining the important features.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers take the output of the convolutional and pooling layers and learn to classify the car images based on the extracted features.

Output Layer: This layer produces the final classification probabilities for each car brand using an appropriate activation function (e.g., softmax).

# Training and Evaluation

To train the car brand prediction model using CNN, the following steps are typically followed:

Data Preprocessing: The car images should be preprocessed before training the model. This may include resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and converting them to the appropriate format.

Model Compilation: The CNN model needs to be compiled with an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric. For multi-class classification, categorical cross-entropy is commonly used as the loss function.

Model Training: The training process involves feeding the preprocessed images to the CNN model in batches, computing the loss, and updating the model's weights using backpropagation. The training should be performed for multiple epochs to allow the model to learn the underlying patterns effectively.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model should be evaluated using a separate validation set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Testing: Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to predict the car brands for unseen images from the testing set. The model's predictions can be compared with the ground truth labels to evaluate its generalization ability.
